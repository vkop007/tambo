Mistral AI provides a range of powerful language models designed for professional use cases and complex reasoning tasks. This page covers the Mistral models available in Tambo, their capabilities, and how to configure them.

<Callout type="warning" title="Known Rendering Issues">
  Mistral models (Large 2.1 and Medium 3) may inconsistently follow rendering

## Available Models

Tambo supports three Mistral models, ranging from frontier-class reasoning to high-performance production models.

### Magistral Medium 1

**Status:** Tested
**API Name:** `magistral-medium-2506`
**Context Window:** 40,000 tokens

A frontier-class reasoning model released in June 2025, designed for advanced problem-solving and analytical tasks.

**Best for:**

- Complex reasoning and multi-step problem solving
- Code generation and debugging
- Professional knowledge work requiring deep analysis
- Tasks benefiting from extended thinking

**Provider Documentation:** [Mistral AI - Magistral](https://mistral.ai/news/magistral)

### Mistral Medium 3

**Status:** Known Issues
**API Name:** `mistral-medium-2505`
**Context Window:** 128,000 tokens

Designed to be frontier-class, particularly excelling in categories of professional use. This model provides a balance of power and versatility for production workloads.

**Best for:**

- Professional applications requiring reliable performance
- Long-form content generation and analysis
- Multi-document reasoning with large context windows
- Production deployments where consistency matters

**Notes:** May occasionally resist rendering as requested. Try clarifying instructions (e.g., "Return a bulleted list only"). Outputs may have formatting quirks when structure is important.

### Mistral Large 2.1

**Status:** Known Issues
**API Name:** `mistral-large-latest`
**Context Window:** 128,000 tokens

Mistral's top-tier large model for high-complexity tasks, with the latest version released in November 2024. This model represents Mistral's most capable offering for demanding workloads.

**Best for:**

- High-complexity reasoning and analysis
- Advanced code generation and review
- Multi-turn conversations requiring context retention
- Tasks demanding maximum model capability

**Notes:** Similar to Medium 3, may inconsistently follow rendering instructions. Validate outputs where structure is critical.

## Configuration

### Setting Up Mistral in Your Project

1. Navigate to your project in the Tambo dashboard
2. Go to **Settings** → **LLM Providers**
3. Add or configure your Mistral API credentials
4. Select your preferred [Mistral model](#available-models)
5. Adjust token limits and parameters as needed
6. Click **Save** to apply your configuration

### Custom Parameters

Mistral models support standard LLM parameters like temperature, max tokens, and more. Configure these in the dashboard under [**Custom LLM Parameters**](/models/custom-llm-parameters).

For detailed information on available parameters, see [Custom LLM Parameters](/models/custom-llm-parameters).

## Model Comparison

| Model              | Context Window | Status       | Best Use Case               |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ------------ | --------------------------- |
| Magistral Medium 1 | 40K tokens     | Tested       | Reasoning & problem solving |
| Mistral Medium 3   | 128K tokens    | Known Issues | Professional applications   |
| Mistral Large 2.1  | 128K tokens    | Known Issues | High-complexity tasks       |

## Best Practices

### Choosing the Right Model

- **Start with [Magistral Medium 1](#magistral-medium-1)** for reasoning-heavy tasks where the smaller context window is sufficient
- **Use [Mistral Medium 3](#mistral-medium-3)** when you need larger context windows for professional applications
- **Reserve [Mistral Large 2.1](#mistral-large-2-1)** for the most demanding tasks requiring maximum capability

### Handling Rendering Issues

If you encounter formatting inconsistencies with [Medium 3](#mistral-medium-3) or [Large 2.1](#mistral-large-2-1):

1. **Clarify instructions** - Be explicit about desired output format
2. **Use structured prompts** - Provide clear examples of expected structure
3. **Validate outputs** - Add checks for critical formatting requirements
4. **Test thoroughly** - Run a prompt suite to verify behavior in your workload

For production-critical formatting, consider using [**Tested**](/models/labels) models and validating outputs. See [Labels](/models/labels) for more guidance.

## Troubleshooting

**Model not appearing in dashboard?**

- Verify your Mistral API key is [configured correctly](#setting-up-mistral-in-your-project)
- Check that your Tambo Cloud instance is up to date
- Ensure you have proper permissions for your project

**Inconsistent formatting in responses?**

- This is a [known issue](#available-models) with [Medium 3](#mistral-medium-3) and [Large 2.1](#mistral-large-2-1) models
- Try being more explicit in your prompt instructions
- Consider using [Magistral Medium 1](#magistral-medium-1) if formatting is critical
- See [Labels](/models/labels) for detailed behavior notes

**High token usage?**

- [Mistral Large 2.1](#mistral-large-2-1) and [Medium 3](#mistral-medium-3) have 128K context windows
- Monitor your input length and conversation history
- Use token limits in [dashboard settings](#setting-up-mistral-in-your-project) to control costs
- Consider [Magistral Medium 1](#magistral-medium-1) for shorter context needs
