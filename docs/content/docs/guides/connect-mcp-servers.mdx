## What You Can Do With MCP

MCP servers extend Tambo's capabilities by providing:

- **Tools** - Functions the AI can execute (query databases, call APIs, perform calculations)
- **Resources** - Access to files, documentation, and data sources
- **Prompts** - Pre-configured prompt templates with context
- **Elicitations** - Interactive data collection from users

## Connection Methods

Tambo supports two ways to connect MCP servers:

### Server-Side Connections (Recommended)

Configure MCP servers through the Tambo dashboard. These run on Tambo's backend infrastructure and provide the most efficient communication.

**Best for:** Production applications, shared services, OAuth-authenticated services

**Setup:**

1. Navigate to your project in the [Tambo Cloud dashboard](https://console.tambo.co)
2. Go to the "MCP Servers" section
3. Click "Add Server"
4. Enter the server connection details:
   - **Server Name** - A descriptive name for your reference
   - **Server URL** - The MCP server endpoint
   - **Authentication** - Configure OAuth or API key headers if required
5. Click "Connect" to establish the connection
6. Test the connection by viewing available tools and resources

**Server features are now available to your AI agent automatically.** When users ask questions or request actions that match the server's capabilities, Tambo will use the appropriate tools and resources.

### Client-Side Connections

Connect MCP servers from your browser using the `@tambo-ai/react` SDK. This approach runs the MCP connection in the user's browser.

**Best for:** Development, testing, user-specific credentials, local services

**Setup:**

> **Dependency note**
>
> The `@tambo-ai/react/mcp` subpath declares `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `zod`, and `zod-to-json-schema` as optional peer dependencies. If you import this subpath, install these packages:
>
> ```bash
> npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk@^1.24.0 zod@^4.0.0 zod-to-json-schema@^3.25.0
> ```

Configure MCP servers in your React application:

```tsx title="app/layout.tsx"
import { TamboProvider } from "@tambo-ai/react";
import { MCPTransport } from "@tambo-ai/react/mcp";

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <TamboProvider
          projectKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_TAMBO_API_KEY}
          mcpServers={[
            {
              url: "http://localhost:8123/",
              serverKey: "local", // Optional: stable prefix for namespacing
              customHeaders: {}, // Optional: custom headers like API keys
              transport: MCPTransport.HTTP, // Optional: defaults to HTTP
            },
          ]}
        >
          {children}
        </TamboProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

`TamboProvider` automatically establishes connections to the specified MCP servers and makes their capabilities available to Tambo.

**Transport options:**

- `MCPTransport.HTTP` (default) - For HTTP-based MCP servers
- `MCPTransport.SSE` - For Server-Sent Events transport

**Note:** Client-side connections require the MCP server to support browser-based connections. Most MCP servers support HTTP transport, which works well from browsers.

## Authentication

### OAuth Authentication (Server-Side Only)

For OAuth-protected MCP servers:

1. Configure the OAuth flow in the Tambo dashboard
2. Complete the OAuth authorization when prompted
3. Tambo will handle token refresh automatically

**Current limitation:** OAuth tokens are shared across all users in your project. All users will act as the same identity when using OAuth-authenticated servers. Per-user OAuth is planned for a future release.

### API Key Authentication

For API key-based servers:

**Server-side:** Configure custom headers in the dashboard with your API key.

**Client-side:** Pass headers in the `customHeaders` field:

```tsx
<TamboProvider
  projectKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_TAMBO_API_KEY}
  mcpServers={[
    {
      url: "https://your-mcp-server.com/",
      serverKey: "myserver",
      customHeaders: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${yourApiKey}`,
      },
      transport: MCPTransport.HTTP,
    },
  ]}
>
  {children}
</TamboProvider>
```

## Testing Your Connection

After connecting an MCP server, verify it's working:

1. In the Tambo dashboard, view the "Tools" and "Resources" tabs to see what's available
2. Test a simple tool execution from the dashboard
3. In your application, ask the AI a question that requires the MCP server's capabilities
4. Check that the AI successfully uses the tools and returns results

## Common MCP Servers

Popular MCP servers you can connect:

- **GitHub** - Access repositories, issues, and pull requests
- **Linear** - Manage issues and projects
- **Supabase** - Query your database
- **Filesystem** - Access local files and documents
- **Google Drive** - Read and search documents
- **Slack** - Send messages and search conversations

Many applications provide MCP servers. Check the [MCP server directory](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/servers) for available integrations.

## Troubleshooting

### Server won't connect

- Verify the server URL is correct and accessible
- Check that authentication credentials are valid
- For client-side connections, ensure the server supports HTTP or SSE transport
- Review browser console for connection errors

### Tools aren't being used

- Verify the server connection is active in the dashboard
- Check that tool descriptions clearly explain what they do
- Ensure the user's question matches the tool's capabilities
- Review the AI's instructions to ensure it's allowed to use tools

### OAuth errors

- Re-authenticate the OAuth connection in the dashboard
- Verify the OAuth app has the required scopes
- Check that the OAuth redirect URL matches your configuration
