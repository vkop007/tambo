Learn how to create a new Tambo project through the dashboard to start building AI-powered applications.

## Step 1: Sign Up or Log In

Go to [tambo.co](https://tambo.co) and create an account or log in to your existing account.

## Step 2: Create a New Project

1. Click "Create Project" in the dashboard
2. Enter a project name (e.g., "My Chat App")

## Step 3: Get Your API Key

1. Click the "Create API Key" button
2. Copy your project API key

## Step 4: Add to Your Application

Add the API key to your environment variables:

```bash title=".env.local"
NEXT_PUBLIC_TAMBO_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Note that this example uses NextJS client environment variable naming, but NextJS is not required.

Then pass it to TamboProvider in your React application:

```tsx title="app/layout.tsx"
import { TamboProvider } from "@tambo-ai/react";

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <TamboProvider projectKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_TAMBO_API_KEY}>
          {children}
        </TamboProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```
