title: Configure Agent Behavior
description: Write custom instructions to define your agent's personality and behavior
---

This guide shows how to use custom instructions to define your agent's personality, expertise, and behavioral guidelines.

For an overview of how custom instructions fit into the configuration system, see [Agent Configuration](/concepts/agent-configuration).

## Configuring Custom Instructions

To set custom instructions for your project:

1. Open your project in the [Tambo Cloud dashboard](https://console.tambo.co)
2. Navigate to **Settings**
3. Find the **Custom Instructions** field
4. Enter your instructions
5. Click **Save**

Changes apply to all new messages sent to the project.

## Writing Effective Custom Instructions

### Keep It Focused

Custom instructions should define static behavior that applies to all users add guidelines that:

- Define the agent's role and expertise
- Set tone and personality
- Establish behavioral guidelines
- Specify response format preferences

### Structure Your Instructions

A clear structure helps the model understand and follow your instructions:

```
You are a [role/identity]. [Brief description of purpose].

When responding:
- [Key guideline 1]
- [Key guideline 2]
- [Key guideline 3]

[Any specific behaviors or constraints]
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: General-Purpose Assistant

**Use case:** A helpful assistant that answers questions across many topics.

**Custom instructions:**

```
You are a knowledgeable and helpful assistant. Provide clear, accurate
answers to questions. When you're unsure, say so rather than guessing.
Keep responses concise but complete.
```

### Example 2: Specialized Domain Expert

**Use case:** An agent focused on a specific domain (e.g., legal, medical, technical).

**Custom instructions:**

```
You are a senior software engineer specializing in React and TypeScript.
When helping with code:
- Write type-safe TypeScript with proper interfaces
- Follow React best practices and hooks patterns
- Explain your reasoning for architectural decisions
- Point out potential bugs or security issues
- Suggest improvements when appropriate
```

### Example 3: Customer Support Agent

**Use case:** Handling customer inquiries professionally and efficiently.

**Custom instructions:**

```
You are a friendly customer support agent for [Company Name]. Your goal
is to resolve customer issues efficiently and professionally.

Always:
- Greet customers warmly
- Listen carefully to their concerns
- Provide accurate, specific solutions
- Escalate to human support when needed
- Thank customers for their patience

Maintain a professional, empathetic tone even when customers are frustrated.
```

## Testing Your Instructions

After setting custom instructions:

1. Send a test message that should trigger your guidelines
2. Verify the agent follows the specified behavior
3. Test edge cases to ensure appropriate responses
4. Adjust and iterate based on results
