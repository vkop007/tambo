Tambo is a generative UI SDK for React. The AI dynamically decides which components to render and what props to pass based on natural language conversations.

Register your components once. The AI agent renders and controls them based on user messages and context.

**MCP-native** from the ground up — integrates the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a standardized protocol that lets AI models connect to external systems (databases, APIs, files) the same way.

## Why Tambo?

You don't want to write 200 lines of boilerplate to show a chart.

Tambo handles:

- ✅ AI orchestration (which component to render)
- ✅ Streaming (progressive prop updates)
- ✅ State management (persistence across conversation)
- ✅ Error handling (retries, fallbacks)
- ✅ Tool coordination (MCP servers, local functions)

You write:

- Your existing React components
- Zod schemas for props
- React hooks for advanced AI features

That's the entire API.

```tsx
// Register your chart component once
const components: TamboComponent[] = [{
  name: "Graph",
  description: "Displays data as charts",
  component: Graph,
  propsSchema: z.object({ data: z.array(...), type: z.enum(["line", "bar", "pie"]) })
}];

// 10 lines of registration → infinite use cases
```

## Key Benefits

- **No AI Expertise Needed** - If you can write React, you can build generative UIs. Use your existing design system and components.
- **MCP-Native** - Built-in support for Model Context Protocol means plug-and-play integrations with any MCP server. Your own, or external servers with Linear, Slack.
- **Pre-built UI Primitives** - Copy/paste production-ready components for forms, charts, maps, messaging, and more. Customize everything.
- **Bring Your Own LLM** - Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Cerebras, Google, Mistral, or any OpenAI-compatible provider. Not locked into one vendor.
- **Truly Open Source** - MIT licensed React SDK and backend. Self-host with full control, or use Tambo Cloud for zero-config deployment.

## How Tambo Works

Tambo supports two component workflows:

**Generative components** (like charts) **or persistent components** (like shopping carts that update across the conversation).

### Generative Components

AI renders these once in response to user messages. Best for charts, data visualizations, and summary cards.

```tsx
const components: TamboComponent[] = [
  {
    name: "Graph",
    description: "Displays data as charts using Recharts library",
    component: Graph,
    propsSchema: z.object({
      data: z.array(z.object({ name: z.string(), value: z.number() })),
      type: z.enum(["line", "bar", "pie"]),
    }),
  },
];
```

### Interactable Components

Components that persist on the page and update by ID across conversations. Perfect for shopping carts, spreadsheets, task boards, or dashboards. Pre-place them in your code, or let AI generate them dynamically.

```tsx
const InteractableNote = withInteractable(Note, {
  componentName: "Note",
  description: "A note supporting title, content, and color modifications",
  propsSchema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    content: z.string(),
    color: z.enum(["white", "yellow", "blue", "green"]).optional(),
  }),
});
```

## Core Workflow

### 1. Register Your Components

Tell the AI which components it can use:

```tsx
import { TamboProvider } from "@tambo-ai/react";

export function Home() {
  return (
    <TamboProvider
      components={myTamboComponents}
      tools={myTamboTools}
      apiKey={tamboApiKey}
    >
      <MyAiApp />
    </TamboProvider>
  );
}
```

For apps with signed-in users, pass a per-user `userToken` (OAuth access token) to `TamboProvider` to enable per-user auth and connect Tambo to your app's end-user identity. See [User Authentication](/concepts/user-authentication) for details.

### 2. Use Tambo Hooks

Send messages and render AI responses with dynamic components:

```tsx
const { thread } = useTamboThread();
const { value, setValue, submit, isPending } = useTamboThreadInput();

// Render messages with components
{
  thread.messages.map((message) => (
    <div key={message.id}>
      {Array.isArray(message.content) ? (
        message.content.map((part, i) =>
          part.type === "text" ? <p key={i}>{part.text}</p> : null,
        )
      ) : (
        <p>{String(message.content)}</p>
      )}
      {message.renderedComponent}
    </div>
  ));
}
```

import { MessageCircleMore } from "lucide-react";

/>

### 3. Add MCP Integrations

Connect pre-built integrations (Linear, Slack, databases) or your own custom MCP servers:

```tsx
import { MCPTransport } from "@tambo-ai/react/mcp";

const mcpServers = [
  {
    name: "filesystem",
    url: "http://localhost:8261/mcp",
    transport: MCPTransport.HTTP,
  },
];

<TamboProvider components={components} mcpServers={mcpServers}>
  <App />
</TamboProvider>;
```
